# 12VDC 130 RPM DC Gear Motor with Magnetic Encoder
This product is a DC gear motor that contains a Magnetic Encoder solder to the end leads of the motor. These motors will use magnetic hall effect sensor to determine the position of the motor. Excellent for position and control systems or related projects. 

Requires a 5VDC Micro-controller to interpret control and position.

## Resolution for quadruple precision

```math
 R = mH \cdot s \cdot r,
```

where $R$ is the resolution of the encoder for quadruple precision, $mH$ number of counts per revolution of the motor shaft, $s$ the number of states generated by the channels AB (i.e. 4), $r$ the reduction ratio of the reduction box (ratio). Hence


```math
 R = 11 \times 4 \times 45 = 1980
```
